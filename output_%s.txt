The paper also explores the convergence of these automata to a continuum limit and provides examples of bugs with increasing radius.

This research paper discusses Euclidean automata (EA) and their generalization to RealLife D family of EA. It shows that RealLife EA are continuous on a comeager set in the natural L1 norm and their dynamics vary continuously with parameters and neighborhood K. It also presents that RealLife EA are the continuum limits of Larger than Life CA and construct families of nontrivial still lifes for RealLife EA. Finally, it introduces the Hausdorff metric and shows that a still life is often surrounded by a neighborhood of other still lifes.

These results are proven using mathematical proofs and convolutional approximation of identity.

The research paper discusses the constant value of a variable on two intersecting cubes, C and A. It shows that the value of a on C is determined by whether all elements of C are within a B-cube outside or inside A. Using this information, it is concluded that a(x) can be expressed as a sum of two terms, one involving the intersection of C and A and the other involving the intersection of A and a translated version of itself. The paper also presents two claims to control the right hand side of this equation, with one claim showing that for any x and y in RD, the number of elements in their respective cubes is equal, and the other claim demonstrating that as t increases, elements enter and exit Wt at the same rate.

This research paper discusses the construction of still lifes shaped like slowly curving ribbons through R2. The paper presents Proposition 3.5, which defines the functions S 1 and in order to determine whether a flat ribbon of width w is a still life. The conditions for a flat ribbon to be a still life are if s0 is between (w) and b0, and if S 1 (w) is less than s1. Additionally, the paper mentions the special case where s0 = b0 and extends the proof to this scenario.

The research paper discusses a proof that any narrow ribbon with small curvature is considered a still life. The proof is based on the distance between points on the ribbon and its center line. It is also shown that this proof can be extended to a slightly curved ribbon as long as the curvature is small enough. A generalization of the proof is also presented for a RealLife EA with a convolution kernel.

Overall, the paper aims to provide a better understanding of symmetry in mathematical structures.

This research paper proves that for any given values of r and R, if certain conditions are met, then the function ar,R will result in a still life. The proof involves using a hyperplane and flat curtain to show that the values of ar,R are independent of orientation and symmetry. The paper also defines various functions and values, such as bR and s0, to further support the conclusion.

The research paper discusses the robustness of still lifes in the Hausdorff metric. It introduces Proposition 3.6(c) which describes two classes of bubble-shaped still lifes with small and large internal cavities. The small cavity bubbles satisfy the condition B 1 (r, R) > b1 while the large cavity bubbles must satisfy the condition B 0 (r, R) < b0 . The paper also extends this proposition to Larger than Life CA with some caveats. The paper defines the Hausdorff metric and a metric for 1AR.

Overall, the paper provides a method for proving the closeness of two objects in relation to still lifes.
