Machine learning has become very popular nowadays, especially with the advancements in information technologies and the emergence of big data. Machine learning involves the use of algorithms to enhance behaviors and find solutions based on previous experiences and data. This technology is used in various fields such as natural language processing, image processing, and finance. The study provides a detailed overview of machine learning, including its history, methods, and applications.

This research paper discusses the concept of machine learning and its applications. Machine learning is the process of equipping computers with the ability to learn from data and make decisions, similar to the human brain. It aims to create models that can continuously improve and solve complex problems using previous data. The term "artificial intelligence" was first used in 1956 during a summer school by scientists from various universities.

The development of machine learning began with the creation of the checkers programme in 1959 and was further accelerated by advancements in game technologies in the 1990s. Nowadays, it is widely used in research and various industries. Machine learning can be divided into four categories: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforced learning. Supervised learning uses input data to reach a result set and can be further categorized into classification and regression methods. Unsupervised learning does not have an output data and relies on relationships between data points, with two types being clustering and association. Features related to data groups or categories may not always be known.

This research paper discusses different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. It also explains the structure and basic functions of artificial neural networks. The paper highlights the importance of selecting features and combining them in order to improve the accuracy of predictions. Additionally, it emphasizes the use of unlabelled data in semi-supervised learning and the role of rewards in reinforcement learning.

This research paper discusses the different functions used in artificial neural networks, including the summation function which calculates the total input in a cell. The activation function is also explained, which is used to calculate the output value corresponding to the input value. The most commonly used activation function is the sigmoid function because it is derivable and important for the learning process. The output value can be sent to other cells or to the outer world. The paper also mentions single layer and multilayer neural networks.

The research paper discusses the history and development of artificial neural networks, specifically focusing on single layer and multilayer networks. It explains how these networks work, including the use of weights and threshold values, and how they are trained using the delta rule. The most commonly used network is the multilayer network, which emerged during studies to solve nonlinear problems. The paper also discusses the role of input and output layers in these networks.

This research paper discusses the two types of artificial neural network architectures, feedforward and back propagation, and their characteristics. It also mentions decision trees as a popular classification algorithm due to its simplicity and reliability.

The research paper discusses the three main structures of a decision tree: decision nodes, branches, and leaves. Decision nodes indicate the dependent variable and determine the classification. Interior nodes have one incoming branch and multiple outgoing branches, while leaf or terminal nodes have an incoming branch but no outgoing branch. The depth of the nodes at the end of each branch can be determined by analyzing the data set. The depth and number of groups in a decision tree are directly proportional. The tree is shaped by questions and their answers, creating rules based on the variables. Each feature is used as a test to determine the classification at the end of a branch. The goal of the decision tree is to reach the desired group in the data through sequencing nodes.

This research paper discusses the use of decision trees for classification tasks. The main focus is on selecting the best feature for each node in the tree, which is done by calculating the information gain or entropy. Pruning techniques are also discussed as a way to prevent overfitting of the model.

This research paper discusses various decision tree methods, including C&RT, C4.5, C5.0, CHAID, SLIQ, and SPRINT. These methods use different processes such as Gini-based division, information gain, and chi-square tests to create decision trees and classify data. The paper also mentions support vector machines as a supervised classification technique.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for classification of data into two categories. They work by finding the hyperplane that separates the data of two classes most appropriately. SVM can be divided into two categories: linearly separable and linearly inseparable. In linearly separable cases, the goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the nearest points to the SVM. This hyperplane is called the optimum hyperplane and the points that define it are called support vectors. In linearly inseparable cases, an artificial variable is used to balance minimizing classification errors. The problem is then solved by displaying the data in a high dimensional space and using kernel functions to determine hyperplanes for linear separation.

The research paper discusses the use of a Kernel function to handle linearly inseparable data. It also explains the application of Naive Bayes classification, a statistical method used for labeling data. The paper presents Bayes theorem and how it is used to estimate the probability of a new data point belonging to a certain class. The formula for calculating this probability is also provided.

Logistic regression is a classification method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. It is commonly used in social sciences and medical sciences. Unlike other regression methods, it does not require the independent variables to be continuous or normally distributed. It also does not assume equal variances or no link problems among the independent variables. The reliability of the model can be determined after predicting the coefficients.

The research paper discusses the use of Chi Square and log similarity function to determine the fitness of a model in data classification. The Wald and Score tests are used to evaluate the significance of the model and its variables. The K-nearest neighbours algorithm is also discussed, which uses distance calculations to classify new data based on previously categorized data. Different distance calculation methods are used, such as Cosinus, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances.

The research paper discusses the use of machine learning algorithms in various fields, including education. It highlights the advantages of using machine learning, such as increased success rates and effective results in noisy data, but also mentions some disadvantages, such as the uncertainty in distance measurement and time-consuming calculations. The paper also mentions specific studies that have used machine learning to predict students' success and identify at-risk students in higher education.
